# Night Desk Neuro Guide

*Understanding the ADHD-friendly design principles behind Night Desk*

## Working Memory Offload → Single Inbox

### The Challenge
ADHD brains have limited working memory capacity. When we try to hold multiple tasks, ideas, and reminders in our heads simultaneously, we experience:
- Mental fatigue and overwhelm
- Forgotten important items
- Difficulty prioritizing
- Analysis paralysis

### The Solution: External Brain
Night Desk provides a **single capture point** for everything:
- One Inbox for all input types (tasks, ideas, notes, links, files)
- No decision-making required during capture
- Immediate cognitive relief through externalization
- Mobile-friendly for on-the-go brain dumps

**Why it works:** Your brain can relax knowing everything is safely captured in one predictable place.

## Implementation Intentions (If/Then/At)

### The Science
Research by Peter Gollwitzer shows that implementation intentions significantly improve task completion rates, especially for people with executive function challenges.

### The Framework
Instead of vague intentions like "I'll write the report," create specific if-then-at statements:
- **If**: The trigger condition
- **Then**: The specific action
- **At**: The context or location

### Examples
- **If** I sit down at my desk with coffee **Then** I'll write for 25 minutes **At** my writing station
- **If** I finish checking email **Then** I'll review my Now tasks **At** the Home — Today page
- **If** I feel overwhelmed **Then** I'll do a 5-minute brain dump **At** the Inbox

**Why it works:** Pre-made decisions reduce cognitive load and increase follow-through by creating automatic behavioral chains.

## Spacing and Resurfacing

### The Forgetting Curve Problem
ADHD brains are particularly susceptible to "out of sight, out of mind." Important tasks and ideas disappear from awareness once they're not immediately visible.

### Spaced Repetition for Tasks
Night Desk uses **gentle resurfacing** to combat this:
- Items reappear in your Resurface Lane on scheduled dates
- Flexible snoozing (+1d, +3d, +7d) prevents overwhelming days
- Daily cap system (max 3 tasks, 3 notes) maintains cognitive manageability

### Strategic Timing
- **+1 day**: For urgent follow-ups or quick wins
- **+3 days**: For medium-priority items or after completing related work
- **+7 days**: For periodic reviews or long-term projects

**Why it works:** Distributed practice strengthens memory and ensures nothing important gets permanently forgotten.

## Timeboxing for Time Blindness

### The Time Blindness Challenge
Many people with ADHD struggle with:
- Estimating how long tasks will take
- Getting lost in hyperfocus
- Difficulty transitioning between activities
- Procrastination due to unclear time commitments

### The Timebox Solution
Every task in Night Desk includes:
- **Effort (hrs)**: Realistic time estimate
- **Timebox (min)**: Focused work session length
- **Scene**: Context for the type of work

### Recommended Timeboxes
- **25 minutes**: Standard Pomodoro for most tasks
- **15 minutes**: For overwhelming or avoided tasks
- **45 minutes**: For deep work or creative flow
- **5 minutes**: For quick wins and momentum building

**Why it works:** Clear time boundaries reduce anxiety, improve task initiation, and create natural stopping points.

## Body-Doubling Page Idea

### The Isolation Problem
Working alone can be particularly challenging for ADHD brains due to:
- Lack of external accountability
- Difficulty with self-regulation
- Increased distractibility
- Reduced motivation

### Virtual Body-Doubling Setup
Use the **People** database to track body-doubling partners:
- **Role**: Body-Double
- **Availability**: When they're typically available
- **Projects**: What you work on together
- **Contact**: How to reach them

### Implementation Ideas
1. **Scheduled Sessions**: Regular co-working times with accountability partners
2. **Project Pairing**: Match specific projects with specific body doubles
3. **Check-in System**: Use the Notes database to track session outcomes
4. **Flexible Arrangements**: Some people prefer video on, others just presence

**Why it works:** External presence provides gentle accountability and reduces the isolation that can derail productivity.

## The Gentle Approach

### Why "Gentle"?
Traditional productivity systems often feel punitive to ADHD brains. Night Desk emphasizes:
- **Compassionate self-talk**: No shame for missed deadlines or forgotten tasks
- **Flexible systems**: Easy to adjust when life changes
- **Sustainable practices**: Designed for long-term use, not short-term sprints
- **Energy awareness**: Respects natural rhythms and capacity fluctuations

### Building Trust with Your System
- Start small with just Inbox capture
- Gradually add complexity as habits form
- Celebrate small wins and progress
- Adjust the system to fit your brain, not the other way around

### When the System Breaks Down
It's normal for any system to occasionally break down. When this happens:
1. Don't abandon everything - just restart with Inbox capture
2. Do a gentle review of what wasn't working
3. Make one small adjustment at a time
4. Remember that imperfect use is better than no use

**Remember:** The goal isn't perfection - it's creating a supportive external structure that works with your ADHD brain, not against it.
